When I moved into my apartment about three years ago, I wanted to _build_ a table.  Passion seems to have kept me working on it until I finished it with a friend of mine using only wood, wood, glue and adjustable, metal feet.

Not that I necessarily needed one or am very knowledgable about woodcraft, I just found for wooden legs in my stairway, so I built a tabletop for them.

The tabletop is built from two (originally three) planks—usually used for floors—cut into halves.
