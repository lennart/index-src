  In order to keep an overview of all the things I do
  <del>on a computer</del> I made this page.
</p>
<p>
  What you are seeing is the main entry point from which each individual piece of my works can be reached.
</p>
<p>
  Most of these projects are collaborative efforts. The whole is divided into rough chapters that map to periods of my life in the
  <del>computing</del> world, others might say this is a curriculum vitae, I would rather call it a living document
